                        <h2>MULTIMODAL LEARNING</h2>
                     
      
                        <p>‘To perfect what you’re learning, you have to learn it in more than one way’ We teach our children different subjects and topics with various approaches, that go beyond the conventional teaching methodology such as textbooks and tasks. We believe that the most appropriate way of teaching is to perfect it by transferring the knowledge using diverse interactive methods such as the internet, worksheets, projects, audio notes, plays, videos and more. Every student has their own pace of understanding conceptsand adapting to learning something new, that’s where the typical textbook learning comes to limit. Our multi-modal learning mechanism gives students an opportunity to cultivate an interest and also learn subjects through our creative, value based learning method and our leadership foundation. It includes: </p>
      
                        <p><b>Butterfly fields</b>-a hands on activity based learning module in maths and science. Students get a chance to practice science and maths concepts with the given kits. This cultivates innovative learning among children. Nature walks by primary students as a part of heuristic learning. </p>
      
                        <p><b>Interactive Panels</b> to provide digital support in all subjects.Communication activities for speaking skill development.</p>
      
                        <p><b>Field trips</b> to learn how concepts are applied in real life. Lab activities- for experiential learning.</p>
      
                        <p><b>Learning by Doing</b>  The school has taken a step ahead in its science teaching, with the introduction of Butterfly Field projects to give a chance for holistic learning to the students.</p>

                    <div class="activity_card_brife_para">
                      <p>We believe in learning through experiencing. We take matters outside the classroom to provide students with a working knowledge of the lessons they learn. We give students virtual tours of the solar system, make use of plays to enact lessons of history and play speeches given by great men such as Nehru and Lincoln to inspire greatness in our students. Students watch video lessons in class that explain concepts in creative, interesting ways. We conduct programs that instill curiosity and inquisitiveness in the younger ones. Music At Phoenix Greens, we also teach our children the culture of music and make them appreciate every genre of music. Our Instructors train our children the Eastern as well as Western forms of music during their timely music sessions. Dance and Drama We ensure we continue the dance and drama activities through the year for our children, in one way or another possible. We believe that overcoming their stage fear will not only give them confidence but also build a leadership quality in them. Quizzes and Competitions We expose our children to various quizzes and competitions such as Math and Science Olympiads, Spelling Bees, Literature, Geographical bees and more. We allow them to participate in State and International level competitions to build awareness, grow their knowledge in all fields and also bring them a sense of competitive spirit that goes beyond the boundaries of school level. We regularly host Olympiads, NSF spelling bees, Romain Rolland state and national level exam conducted for French students and other fun competitions relating to Diwali, Holi, Rakhi and more. Field Trips Field trips are a very important part of the curriculum at Phoenix Greens. We believe it is important for children to enjoy themselves on field trips, but also ensure that the trips hold high educational value - whether history-based or science-based. Children are given the opportunity experience learning outdoors, away the confines of the four walls of the classroom. Phoenix EchoPhoenix Echo is the school’s half-yearly magazine managed entirely by students. Teachers supervise the students as they carry out the development of content, design, print and expenses for the magazine and at most provide guidance where necessary. The students learn to handle budgets, maintain deadlines and manage resources in the process. Leadership Foundation Our Leadership foundation is built to pay attention to the children’s outgoing character and growing their skills in various social aspects. The school encourages leadership qualities by conducting elections every year for Junior and senior cabinet. Different clubs and committees such as Lit. club, Health and Wellness Club, IT Club and more select children for the posts of president and Secretary, to shoulder additional responsibilities.</p>

                    <div class="activity_card_brife_para">
                      <p>‘Values are what we live by’ At Phoenix Greens, we foster our children with values that reflect in them in ways such as compassion, humanity, friendly, moral conduct and respect for others. Our children volunteer to participate in various social service activities, environment protection and much more. AP Vana Mahotsav, Green Building Congress at Novotel, visiting orphanages and old age-homes are just a glimpse of it. Every year, the school raises funds through services and parents’ supports to donate them into charities. It includes: - Values like cooperation, sharing etc are taught through work education on No Book Days. - Work education for Grades 9 and 10 is planned with the aim for social service. Helper’s Day - Pre Primary Helpers; ie. The Ayah aunties play a pivotal role in a School, especially in a Pre-Primary environment. They provide security, and physical comfort needed by a child. They are the ones who make sure a child is comfortable in class, needs a visit to the wash room or a change of clothing. Phoenix Greens celebrates a Day in their honour on October 5 th . Parents are encouraged to show their appreciation to the Ayahs and the other support staff on this day. Social Service The school exposes children to social service activities building a sense of humility and kindness in them. To increase the social consciousness of the students, the school takes them on frequent visits to orphanages and old age homes, not only to contribute in cash and kind but also to make sure that the students spend time with the children and elderly and learn about the harsh realities of life beyond the comfort of their homes and school. Environmental Care Through lectures, practical sessions and videos, children of all classes are taught the value of nature & embracing the care for it. Our programmes are designed to enrich the child with the sense of safety, hygiene and respect for the nature and environment they live around. We also observe Environment Week every year to make our students more conscious about environmental protection and educate them on environment-friendly practices.</p>

                    <div class="activity_card_brife_para">
                      <p>The foremost practice in this regard is the introduction of scheduled English communicative speaking activities in all classes and for all students to enhance the confidence and communication capacity of our students. Another step in this direction is the inclusion of Drama as a compulsory component in teaching of all languages to make language learning entertaining and to bring out untapped talents of the children. We structure our children’s thoughts and opinions by channeling them through intellectual debates and also support them in educating themselves on the current affairs while also giving them the confidence to boldly speak up facing any level of audience present in front of them. We also hold communication activities twice a month to improve students’ speaking skills. Competitions and other challenges: Besides conducting different competitions in sports and subjects, the School also conducts SOF Olympiads and NSF Bees-in Vocabulary, spelling, Maths and Science- where different schools take part in these competitions and win attractive prizes.</p>
