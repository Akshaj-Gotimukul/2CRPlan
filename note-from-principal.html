                <p>Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man, as Swami Vivekananda once said. At Phoenix Greens School of Learning, we have taken it upon ourselves to unlock this latent perfection in every child under our care. Our aim is to provide a sound value-based environment for our students, where responsible behavior, empathy, and gratitude are part of their daily lives.</p>
                <p>Our curriculum emphasizes values, not only attitudes like sharing and caring but also an attitude of curiosity for learning. We constantly ask ourselves what kind of education our students need to prepare them for life. Over the years, we have incorporated innovative practices to upgrade the quality quotient of our academics and co-curricular activities.</p>
                <p>We believe that communication is the key to success. To enhance our students' communication capacity and confidence, we have introduced scheduled English communicative speaking activities in all classes. We have also made drama a compulsory component in teaching all languages to make language learning entertaining and to bring out our students' untapped talents.</p>
                <p>Our students are taught skills for life through work education in the form of different activities such as cooking, stitching, and gardening. We also conduct science exhibitions every year to keep our students in touch with the latest science and technological inventions of our times.</p>
                <p>We organize different competitions in sports and subjects, including SOF Olympiads and NSF Bees, where different schools take part in these competitions and win attractive prizes. Our school has also not forgotten its social responsibility to the society in which it resides. We take our students on frequent visits to orphanages and old age homes, not only to contribute in cash and kind but also to make sure that the students spend time with the children and elderly and learn about the harsh realities of life beyond the comfort of their homes and school.</p>
                <p>At Phoenix Greens School of Learning, our aim is to make our children dynamic, independent, open-minded, and adaptable in this ever-changing world. We provide an invigorating and inspiring environment so that our students realize their potential to become future leaders, adventurers, trailblazers, icons, and most importantly, good human beings.</p>
                <p>We are proud of our academic excellence, where we treat each individual as a unique being, and academic goals should be as individualistic as the student based on personal interest and talent. We have achieved many recognitions over the years, including being recognized as an outstanding school for our performance in Olympiad exams in 2014-15 and hosting the NSF Bees Finals continuously for seven years.</p>
                <p>Our students have also excelled in sports at international, national, regional, and district levels, winning Bronze Medals in the Asian Budokan Championship, ranking 31st in the Dubai Chess World Championship, and many more achievements.</p>
                <p>We are committed to constant up-gradation of teacher as well as teaching skills and have conducted all the requisite programs in CCE with the help of CBSE empaneled agencies. Our school also takes an inclusive approach towards education, providing remedial classes for children with special needs, and making an in-house counselor readily available for the children to resolve their everyday issues.</p>
                <p>We are proud to be a school that not only excels in academics and sports but also takes its social responsibility seriously. Our students are taught to be compassionate and empathetic towards their fellow beings and contribute towards making the world a better place.</p>
